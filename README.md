## Overview
Binding of Isaac but with two enemies. The focus is on the basic game mechanics such as shooting, movement, rooms, and enemies. We will use processing to display the sprites and we will rip them directly from the game. The game has very minimal UI and no animation at the moment.
## Instructions
Use the W,A,S,D keys to move the player around the room, I,J,K,L keys to aim, and SPACEBAR to shoot bullets.
