## Overview
We are making Binding of Isaac but with a few enemies and only one boss. We are going to focus on the basic game mechanics such as shooting, movement, items, rooms, and enemies. We will use processing to display the sprites and we will rip them directly from the game. We will animate the game using a cycle counter for each sprite to see which frame of animation it is on. We will use PVectors to track the positions of objects and their movement. The game will only include one floor with the shop, the cursed room, the treasure room, and the boss room. The map of the game will be randomly generated from a selection of premade layouts.
## Instructions
Use the W,A,S,D keys to move the player around the room and the space bar to shoot bullets.
